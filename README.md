# Pok-dex-App
Pokédex App on IOS

Using pokeapi created a Pokédex where a user can scroll through a list of pokemon ordered by Pokédex id,
or use a search method. When a person selects an individual pokemon, an api call is made using Alamofire
to the pokeapi in order to retrieve stats on the particular pokemon. 
Stats included are attack, weight, height, bio, next evolution, etc.
